# Countinous Learning
Learning any programming language requires alot from the student, one has to become a beginner every new day they engage with the language of choice as a lot of forgetting happen especially when one does 
make practice the order of their day.

The project covers some aspect of working with existing libraries to understand how everything works under the hood, on this specific one, focus was on Tkinter library to develop a rock paper scissor game

The project allowed me to understand aspects of 

<li>Label</li> 
<p>For eveloping titles that can't be manipulated by users</p>

<li>Entry</li>
For text variable where users can enter details

<li>Buttons</li>
For controlling aspects of the game like, playing, quitting and resetting
